The board in the middle is the Program Counter Module, which serves four main functions:

* Increment the program address
* Allow the program address to be read to the data bus
* Allow the program address to be written to the data bus
* Coordinate reading and writing program memory

In the photo, the Program Counter Module is being tested using some switch and LED modules.
